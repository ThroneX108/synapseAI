Mental Health and Well-being Guide for Students

Depression

Depression is more than just feeling sad for a day or two. It’s a mood disorder that causes persistent feelings of deep sadness or hopelessness, and it can make everyday tasks hard. It can affect sleep, eating, energy and concentration ￼ ￼. Anyone can experience depression regardless of background, and it often makes it hard to enjoy things you used to like ￼ ￼.

Common signs:
	•	Persistent feelings of sadness, emptiness or hopelessness most of the day ￼.
	•	Losing interest in hobbies, friends or activities you used to enjoy ￼.
	•	Changes in sleep or appetite (sleeping much more or less, eating too much or too little) ￼.
	•	Low energy or feeling tired all the time, even after resting ￼.
	•	Trouble concentrating, making decisions or remembering things ￼.
	•	Feelings of guilt, worthlessness or excessive self-criticism ￼.
	•	In severe cases, having thoughts of death or suicide (always take these seriously) ￼.

Coping strategies:
	•	Reach out: Talk to someone you trust (a friend, family member or counselor) about how you feel. You don’t have to go through this alone. Professional help (counseling or a doctor) can also make a big difference.
	•	Stay connected: Try not to isolate yourself. Spending time with positive people or joining a club/group can help lift your mood.
	•	Set small goals: Break tasks into tiny steps (for example, just cleaning one part of your room or writing one paragraph). Celebrate even small accomplishments.
	•	Keep a routine: Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. Eat regular meals and try to exercise or go for a short walk daily ￼. Exercise releases “feel-good” chemicals in the brain and can improve mood ￼.
	•	Engage in simple self-care: Do one enjoyable or relaxing thing each day (listen to music, take a bath, play with a pet). Even small pleasures can help.
	•	Avoid alcohol/drugs: They may seem to relieve depression temporarily but usually make symptoms worse over time.
	•	Seek professional support if needed: Therapy and/or medication can help many people with depression. Early help tends to work better, so don’t wait until things get extremely bad.

Anxiety

Anxiety is a normal reaction to stress, but anxiety disorders involve intense, constant worry or fear that interferes with daily life. You might feel very nervous or on edge, or have panic attacks – sudden intense fear that something awful will happen. Physical feelings can include a racing heart, sweating, trembling or difficulty breathing ￼. People with anxiety disorders often find these feelings hard to control, and the worries are out of proportion to the actual situation ￼.

Common signs:
	•	Feeling nervous, restless or “on edge” a lot of the time ￼.
	•	A sense of dread or panic (feeling that danger or something bad is about to happen) ￼.
	•	Racing heartbeat, shortness of breath or hyperventilation when anxious ￼.
	•	Persistent worrying that’s hard to stop or control (thinking “what if” over and over) ￼.
	•	Sweating, trembling, muscle tension or feeling shaky ￼.
	•	Difficulty concentrating or falling asleep because your mind is racing.
	•	Avoiding places or situations that make you nervous.

Coping strategies:
	•	Relaxation techniques: Practice deep breathing (slowly inhale and exhale), meditation or gentle yoga. These activities calm the nervous system and reduce panic ￼. Apps or YouTube videos can guide simple breathing and meditation exercises.
	•	Stay active: Regular exercise (like walking, running, or sports) is a powerful stress reducer. Even 10–15 minutes of movement daily can improve mood and lower anxiety ￼.
	•	Healthy habits: Eat balanced meals and limit caffeine and sugar, which can worsen anxiety. Make sleep a priority – try to go to bed at a consistent time and get 7–9 hours each night ￼.
	•	Identify triggers: Notice what situations or thoughts tend to spark your anxiety. Once you know them, you can prepare coping strategies (for example, if public speaking makes you anxious, practice giving presentations in a safe environment first).
	•	Talk about it: Share your worries with a friend or family member who will listen without judgment. Sometimes just saying your fears out loud makes them feel less overwhelming.
	•	Professional help: If anxiety feels uncontrollable or is causing panic attacks, consider talking to a counselor or doctor. Therapy (like talking to a mental health counselor) and certain medications can help manage anxiety.
	•	Stick to a plan: If you have prescriptions or therapy exercises, follow them. Consistency (taking meds as directed and keeping therapy appointments) can greatly improve anxiety over time ￼.
	•	Use grounding tricks: When anxious, try describing your surroundings (five things you can see, four things you can touch, etc.) or chewing gum. These small actions can “ground” you in the present moment and break the cycle of panic ￼.

Academic Stress / Exam Pressure

Academic stress (or exam pressure) comes from school or college demands like heavy workloads, tests, deadlines and competition. It’s normal to feel some stress when preparing for exams, but high or chronic stress can harm your health and grades. Students often feel overwhelmed by the “endless to-do list” of assignments, studying and responsibilities ￼ ￼.

Common signs:
	•	Physical: Headaches, muscle tension (like tight shoulders or neck), upset stomach or feeling tired and achy ￼.
	•	Emotional/Mental: Feelings of being overwhelmed, irritable, anxious or depressed. You may feel tearful or short-tempered, or worry constantly about school.
	•	Behavioral: Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much, changes in eating (over- or undereating), skipping classes, procrastinating, or using drugs/alcohol to cope ￼.
	•	Thinking: Difficulty concentrating, poor memory, or “brain fog” when studying. High stress can make it hard to focus on lectures or retain information ￼ ￼.

Coping strategies:
	•	Plan and prioritize: Make a to-do list and rank tasks by importance and deadline. Do the hardest or most urgent tasks first. Break big projects (like writing a paper) into smaller steps (outline, research, draft, edit) and tackle one part at a time ￼. Focus on what you accomplish each day, not on what’s left undone ￼.
	•	Set realistic goals: Don’t aim for perfection in everything. Be flexible if things change. Celebrate completing tasks (even small ones) to build confidence ￼.
	•	Healthy habits: Keep a regular sleep schedule and aim for 7–9 hours of sleep. Good sleep helps memory and stress. Eat nutritious meals (fruits, vegetables, proteins) and drink enough water. Avoid excessive caffeine – it can make you more anxious and disrupt sleep.
	•	Exercise: Even light exercise (a 15-minute walk, stretching or sports) can boost mood and energy and act as a stress outlet ￼. Try to be active most days.
	•	Take breaks: Study in chunks (like 25–50 minutes) and take short breaks in between (stand up, stretch, take deep breaths or go outside for a moment). Brief breaks help your brain reset.
	•	Self-care and relaxation: Do something enjoyable each day – listen to music, play a game, read for fun or practice mindfulness. Activities like meditation or deep breathing exercises can calm anxiety and recharge you ￼.
	•	Stay connected: Talk about your stress with friends or family. Sometimes friends can study together or simply listen. Don’t isolate yourself. Student advisors, tutors or professors can also give guidance or extensions if you explain your situation. As one student noted, just talking to an advisor helped her feel supported ￼.
	•	Ask for help: If stress feels too much, seek support from campus resources (counseling centers, study groups, student services). Professional counselors can teach coping techniques or refer you to resources.

Relationship Difficulties / Breakups

Relationship problems (with friends, family or romantic partners) can cause a lot of stress and sadness. A breakup in particular is like experiencing a loss – you may feel grief, anger or confusion. It’s normal to feel very upset, anxious, or even ashamed after a difficult relationship change. You might also have trouble sleeping, eating, or concentrating on school right after a breakup.

Common signs:
	•	Feeling sad, lonely, angry or guilty much of the time. Even small reminders (music, places, social media) can trigger strong emotions.
	•	Loss of motivation: having trouble focusing on classes or activities you usually do. You may feel numb, or sometimes flooded with tears or rage.
	•	Physical changes: Sleep or appetite may change (sleeping too much or insomnia; eating too little or too much). You might feel tired or have headaches and stomachaches.
	•	Social withdrawal: avoiding friends or activities you used to enjoy, or not wanting to talk about what happened.
	•	Preoccupation with the other person: frequent thoughts about your ex or situation, “what-ifs,” and difficulty moving forward. This rumination can keep the pain fresh.

Coping strategies:
	•	Allow yourself to feel: A breakup causes grief. Give yourself permission to be upset for a while ￼. Understand it’s normal to feel a mix of sadness, anger, confusion or relief all at once. These feelings usually lessen over time ￼. Try not to judge yourself for feeling bad – you’re going through a hard experience.
	•	Talk to someone you trust: Sharing your feelings with a friend, family member or counselor can help you process what happened. You don’t have to carry it all alone. HelpGuide.org advises, “Don’t go through this alone,” and notes that talking can ease stress and prevent isolation ￼.
	•	Focus on yourself: Do things that make you feel cared for. Eat well, get some exercise, and keep up routines as much as possible. Self-care activities (like a hobby, warm bath, or journaling) can stabilize your emotions. In fact, writing about your feelings is often recommended to make sense of them ￼ ￼.
	•	Set boundaries: Limit contact with your ex if seeing them or talking makes you feel worse. Remember, you do not know exactly how your ex feels – their public behavior isn’t about you ￼. Try to stop comparing yourself with what your ex is doing or who they’re with, because that usually increases sadness.
	•	Stay connected: It may feel tempting to isolate, but being with supportive friends and family can remind you that you’re valued. Go out with friends, join clubs or study groups, and lean on people who care about you.
	•	Seek professional help if needed: If you find yourself still deeply depressed or having trouble functioning weeks or months later, consider talking to a counselor. They can help with coping skills and perspective.

Burnout

Burnout is a state of chronic stress leading to exhaustion and loss of motivation. It often develops when you feel overwhelmed by continuous demands (schoolwork, jobs, or responsibilities) with little rest or reward. Burnout feels like feeling physically and mentally drained most of the time ￼. Students may start to feel they don’t care anymore, their goals seem less meaningful, and they can barely muster energy for daily tasks ￼.

Common signs:
	•	Feeling tired and “burnt out” almost every day (persistent fatigue) ￼.
	•	Lack of interest in school, classes or activities you used to care about ￼.
	•	Low motivation or a sense of cynicism (thinking “why bother?” or feeling detached) ￼.
	•	Declining grades or dropping assignments; you might skip classes or procrastinate on work ￼.
	•	Emotional symptoms similar to depression or anxiety (feeling sad, overwhelmed, irritable) ￼.
	•	Sleeping problems (insomnia or sleeping too much) ￼.
	•	Physical issues: headaches, gastrointestinal upset or muscle pain can increase with stress ￼.
	•	Feeling isolated: pulling away from friends or classmates. Ironically, withdrawing often worsens burnout ￼.

Coping strategies:
	•	Rest and step back: Realize it’s okay to take a break. Chronic stress is not a weakness – it’s a sign that you need to rest. Give yourself permission to slow down.
	•	Say “no” sometimes: If you’re overcommitted, it’s acceptable to decline additional work or social activities. You can politely tell people you’re busy and need to focus on self-care ￼. This prevents doing too much and running yourself into the ground.
	•	Rebalance activities: Make time for hobbies or fun activities each week so school isn’t your only focus. Join a club, go for a nature walk, or play sports to clear your mind. Participating in campus events or volunteer work can give you energy and connection ￼ ￼. (Volunteering, in particular, can improve mood and reduce stress ￼.)
	•	Take care of your body: Regular exercise (even just a daily walk) can boost mood and help you cope with stress ￼. Eat balanced meals (plenty of fruits, vegetables, proteins) to keep energy up. Practice good sleep habits: go to bed and wake up at the same time and make your room dark and quiet. Good sleep is key to recovery ￼.
	•	Time management: Try not to cram everything at the last minute. Spread study or work evenly throughout the semester. Use planners or apps to schedule tasks and set small daily goals ￼ ￼. This prevents last-minute panic.
	•	Reach out for support: Talk with friends, family, professors or counselors about how you feel. They may help lighten your load or give practical advice. Many schools offer workshops on stress or offer counseling if you’re struggling. Don’t hesitate to use these resources. Remember, seeking help early can even prevent burnout from fully setting in.

Loneliness and Isolation

Loneliness is feeling alone or disconnected, even if you’re surrounded by people. It can happen when you’re far from home, if you don’t feel like you belong in your new environment, or if you haven’t found close friends yet. Isolation often goes hand-in-hand with loneliness and can lead to emotional distress. Not having someone to talk to can make college life much harder. For many students this feeling is common – surveys show most college-age young adults report feeling lonely ￼.

Common signs:
	•	Feeling sad or empty much of the time, even when you’re not doing anything.
	•	A sense of not fitting in or feeling like no one understands you.
	•	Increased anxiety or low mood, sometimes without obvious cause (loneliness can mimic depression).
	•	Lost interest in activities because you feel “no one’s there to do them with.”
	•	Physical symptoms like tiredness, poor concentration or trouble sleeping can also accompany loneliness ￼. The cited survey links loneliness with feelings like “everything is an effort,” feeling nervous or hopeless ￼.

Coping strategies:
	•	Connect with others: Make an effort to reach out. Send a message or call a friend, even if they are busy. Join a club, sports team, study group or volunteering group to meet people with similar interests. Shared activities can build friendships. The Widener guide emphasizes “staying connected” – reaching out to friends and family who care about you ￼.
	•	Use support services: Many campuses have online forums, clubs or counseling services for students feeling lonely. These spaces can normalize loneliness and provide support. Remember that feeling lonely is a common experience among students, and you’re not alone in this.
	•	Quality over quantity: Focus on building a few deeper connections rather than trying to be friends with everyone. Even one or two close friends can greatly reduce loneliness. Don’t be afraid to open up to someone you trust.
	•	Limit social media comparison: Seeing others’ “perfect” photos can worsen loneliness. Remind yourself that online posts aren’t the whole story, and that many people struggle in private.
	•	Talk to a counselor: If loneliness feels overwhelming or leads to severe anxiety or depression, it’s okay to seek professional help. Therapists can teach coping skills and help you find ways to connect.
	•	Stay involved: Keep a routine. Go to class, study in common areas, eat with others when you can. Small interactions (like chatting after class or saying hi in the dining hall) can slowly build your sense of belonging.
	•	Feeling supported and connected predicts better outcomes for students ￼. By reaching out and finding even small pockets of community, you protect yourself against the negative effects of chronic loneliness.

Sleep Issues

Sleep problems are very common among students. You might lie awake worrying, or sleep at odd times (like late night scrolling or sleeping in too long). Or you might sleep a lot but still feel tired. Poor sleep can make you feel irritable, anxious or depressed, and it hurts memory and focus. Getting enough good sleep is crucial: it boosts mood, improves thinking and even helps your body stay healthy ￼.

Common signs:
	•	Trouble falling asleep or staying asleep (insomnia), or waking up feeling unrefreshed.
	•	Sleeping much more than usual (hypersomnia) and still feeling tired.
	•	Daytime sleepiness or falling asleep in class.
	•	Irritability, mood swings or trouble concentrating due to poor sleep.
	•	If sleep loss continues, you may also have headaches or weakened immunity.

Coping strategies: (Sleep hygiene)
	•	Consistent schedule: Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day (yes, even weekends) ￼. This trains your body’s clock.
	•	Enough time: Aim for 7–9 hours per night. Some people need more, but most adults function best with at least 7 ￼. If you feel extremely sleepy or unwell, try going to bed earlier until you feel rested.
	•	Wind down before bed: Begin a relaxing bedtime routine 1–2 hours before sleep ￼. Avoid screens (phone, computer, TV) during this time – the light from devices can trick your brain into thinking it’s daytime ￼. Do something calming instead: listen to quiet music, read a book (on paper), take a warm shower or do gentle stretches.
	•	Optimal bedroom: Make your sleep space dark, quiet and cool ￼. Block out lights (even from electronics), use ear plugs or white noise if needed. Keep the room around 65–68°F (18–20°C) if possible ￼. Use your bed only for sleep (avoid working or studying in bed) ￼.
	•	Watch food/drinks: Don’t eat heavy or spicy meals right before bed ￼. Limit caffeine and energy drinks late in the day (try to avoid them 5–6 hours before bedtime) ￼. Alcohol might make you sleepy at first but can wake you up later.
	•	Daytime habits: Get some natural light and exercise during the day ￼. Even a brief walk outside helps strengthen your sleep cycle. Avoid naps late in the afternoon (if you nap, keep it under 30 minutes).
	•	Relaxation: If anxiety keeps you up, practice deep breathing or meditation as you lie in bed. Count breaths or scan your body from head to toe, relaxing each part. If you can’t sleep after ~20 minutes, get up and do something quiet (write in a journal or read) until you feel sleepy.

Eating and Body Image Issues (Bingeing, Loss of Appetite)

Students often face unhealthy eating habits during stress. Binge eating (overeating large amounts when stressed) or loss of appetite are signs of disordered coping. Body image issues are also common – feeling unhappy with your body or weight can worsen these problems. If these issues become persistent, they can hurt both physical and mental health.

Common signs:
	•	Binge eating: Frequently eating large amounts of food quickly, often feeling out of control or guilty afterwards.
	•	Skipping meals or restricting: Consistently eating very little or skipping meals, even when hungry, possibly to control weight.
	•	Frequent thoughts about food, weight or appearance: Preoccupation with body size or “fear of gaining weight.”
	•	Physical changes: Noticeable weight loss or weight gain.
	•	Emotional signs: Feeling ashamed of eating behaviors, avoiding social events involving food, or using food to cope with stress (eating to feel better).

Coping strategies:
	•	Mindful eating: Pay attention to your body’s hunger and fullness cues. Try to eat regular, balanced meals even if you’re stressed (mix of protein, grains, fruits/veggies). Nutrition helps energy and mood.
	•	Healthy support: Talk with a counselor or doctor if you’re struggling with eating. Professional guidance (and possibly a nutritionist) can help establish a healthy eating plan and address emotional issues.
	•	Avoid extremes: Stay away from “diet” mentalities like skipping meals or fasting; these usually backfire by making cravings stronger. Similarly, allow yourself treats in moderation so you don’t feel deprived.
	•	Find alternatives: If stress makes you want to binge, pause and try a different activity: drink water, take a short walk, or call a friend.
	•	Positive body talk: Challenge negative thoughts about your body. Remind yourself of what your body can do (walk, dance, hug friends) rather than how it looks. Follow social media or role models that celebrate body diversity and health, not “perfection.”
	•	Self-care and balance: Get enough sleep and exercise regularly – both help regulate appetite and improve body image.
	•	Seek community: There are often support groups for students dealing with eating issues. Sharing experiences can reduce shame and encourage healthy habits.

Self-Esteem and Confidence Problems

Self-esteem is about how much you value and trust yourself. Feeling low self-esteem or confidence can make everyday challenges seem harder and can slow your goals. Students with self-esteem issues often doubt their abilities, worry about others’ opinions, or compare themselves unfavorably to others. This can lead to avoiding new experiences or being very hard on oneself.

Common signs:
	•	Criticizing yourself harshly for mistakes (“I’m so stupid,” “I’ll never get this right”).
	•	Comparing your accomplishments to others and feeling you always come up short.
	•	Fear of trying new things or speaking up because you worry about what others think.
	•	Insecurity or jealousy when others succeed, or feeling you don’t deserve good things.
	•	Sensitivity to criticism; even small feedback feels like major rejection.

Coping strategies:
	•	Positive self-talk: Practice talking to yourself like you would to a friend. If a thought is too negative, challenge it (“Am I really a failure? Even successful people mess up sometimes.”). Replace it with a kinder thought.
	•	Set small goals: Build confidence by setting achievable tasks (for example, study 30 minutes a day, or try a new club activity). When you meet a goal, reward yourself mentally or with something small. Success, even in little things, boosts confidence.
	•	Focus on strengths: Write a list of what you like about yourself or compliments you’ve received. Remind yourself of these qualities regularly.
	•	Seek feedback: Talk to trusted teachers or friends about areas you want to improve. They can give supportive advice. Remember, needing help or learning a new skill doesn’t mean you’re weak.
	•	Limit comparisons: Social media often shows only the highlights of others’ lives. Try to reduce time on platforms that make you feel inadequate.
	•	Develop skills: Join clubs or classes that improve skills you care about (public speaking, writing, art, sports). As you get better at something, your confidence in yourself grows.
	•	Professional help: If low self-esteem is tied to anxiety or depression, therapy can help you reframe beliefs and build confidence.

Procrastination and Motivation Challenges

Procrastination is when you put off tasks even when you know they’re important. It often comes from feeling overwhelmed or fearing failure, but it creates more stress later. Many students procrastinate on homework, studying or chores, which can lead to last-minute panic, poor grades and guilt. Breaking the cycle of procrastination improves your work quality and reduces anxiety.

Common signs:
	•	Regularly delaying work or assignments until the last moment.
	•	Feeling guilty or stressed about tasks you’re avoiding.
	•	Saying you’ll start “tomorrow” and then still not starting.
	•	Difficulty concentrating on tasks even when you plan to.
	•	Doing less important things (like browsing social media) instead of studying.

Coping strategies:
	•	Break it down: Divide large assignments into very small tasks. Instead of “study for final,” make a list like: read one chapter, make flashcards for key terms, review notes for 15 minutes. This makes starting much easier.
	•	Use a schedule: Put tasks on a calendar or to-do list with specific times. Seeing your plan can motivate you to follow through. Use reminders or alarms on your phone.
	•	Set priorities: Tackle the most important or hardest task first (sometimes called “eat the frog” approach). Once the big task is done, smaller ones feel easier.
	•	Remove distractions: Find a quiet study spot. Turn off phone notifications or use apps that block distracting sites while you work.
	•	Reward yourself: Promise yourself a small reward after completing a chunk of work (a snack, a short walk, or 5 minutes on social media). This positive feedback loop boosts motivation.
	•	Accountability: Study or work with a friend or in a group. Telling someone your goal (“I will write this page by 3 PM”) makes you more likely to do it.
	•	Positive mindset: Remind yourself why the task matters (a good grade, learning something useful). Focus on the benefits of finishing rather than the stress of not doing it.

Substance Misuse / Alcohol or Drugs

Many students experiment with alcohol or drugs in college, but using them to cope can become harmful. Drinking in moderation can be social, but binge drinking or frequent use to escape stress is risky. Substance misuse can damage health, academics and safety (like accidents or illness). It can also worsen stress and mental health in the long run ￼.

Common signs:
	•	Drinking or using drugs daily or in large amounts, beyond social use.
	•	Finding it hard to stop or reduce use, even if you want to.
	•	Using alcohol/drugs to deal with stress, anxiety or sadness regularly.
	•	Neglecting responsibilities (skipping classes, poor grades) due to hangovers or drug effects ￼.
	•	Experiencing withdrawal symptoms (nausea, shaking, irritability) when not using.

Coping strategies:
	•	Identify triggers: Notice when you’re most tempted (during stress, in certain friend groups, after a bad day). Being aware lets you plan other coping methods.
	•	Healthy alternatives: When stressed or down, try exercise, deep breathing, talking with a friend or engaging in a hobby instead of substances. Physical activity and social support can boost mood without harm.
	•	Set limits: If you choose to drink, do so in moderation. For alcohol, guidelines suggest limiting to 1 drink per day (women) or 2 (men) on average. Drink slowly with water in between.
	•	Avoid high-risk situations: Skip parties or places where heavy drinking/drug use is the main activity, especially if you feel tempted. You can still socialize in safer environments.
	•	Support networks: Talk honestly with a trusted friend or counselor about your use. They can help you find healthier habits. Many schools have substance misuse counseling or student recovery groups.
	•	Professional help: If you find you can’t control your use, seek professional assistance. Treatment and support groups (like AA or campus counseling) can provide guidance and support to stop or reduce use.

Grief and Loss

Grief is the natural response to losing someone or something important (like a family member, close friend, or even a pet). It’s common after a death or breakup. Grief involves a mix of emotions – sadness, anger, guilt, confusion – and can come and go in waves. Every person’s grief is different and it can last a long time.

Common signs:
	•	Feelings of deep sadness, crying spells or numbness. You may feel “in shock” or disbelief at first.
	•	Anger or irritation (at yourself, others, or the situation).
	•	Physical symptoms: tiredness, restless sleep or insomnia, appetite changes, headaches or stomachaches ￼.
	•	Difficulty concentrating or memory problems. School work may suffer as your mind is preoccupied.
	•	Dwelling on “what could have been,” feeling guilty or regretful about things said/done or not done.
	•	Emotional ups and downs: one moment you’re fine, the next you’re crying.

Coping strategies:
	•	Allow yourself to grieve: It’s OK to feel sad or upset and to cry. Talk about your loss with supportive people. Bottling up emotions often makes grief worse later on.
	•	Stay connected: Even though you might want to be alone, spending time with friends or family can provide comfort. Others can share memories with you or simply sit quietly together.
	•	Self-care: Take care of your body. Eat regular meals, keep up sleep routines, and do light exercise (like walking), which can improve mood. The Widener guide emphasizes sleep, hydration and doing things you love as key self-care during grief ￼.
	•	Journaling or creative outlets: Writing about your feelings or creating art/music can help process grief. As one counselor notes, reflecting through journaling can make sense of emotions and bring peace ￼.
	•	Routine and flexibility: Try to keep up a normal schedule when you can (classes, meals), but give yourself some flexibility. If a task feels too hard today, focus on smaller tasks or resume it tomorrow.
	•	Honor the loss: Find a personal way to remember what you lost, like writing a letter, planting a tree, or making a photo album. Ceremonies or small rituals can provide closure.
	•	Seek support: Many campuses have counseling centers or support groups for grieving students. Talking to a counselor or joining a grief support group can make you feel less alone in your experience.

Barriers to Seeking Help

Students face several hurdles when trying to get mental health support:
	•	Limited availability (Operational barriers): Many campus counseling centers are overloaded. For example, colleges often have far more students per counselor than recommended (sometimes over 2,000 students per counselor) ￼. This leads to long waitlists or very limited appointment times (often only during weekday class hours), making it hard to get timely help.
	•	Stigma and fear of judgment: Even though talking about mental health is more accepted now, many students still worry about what others will think. A student might fear being labeled “crazy” or treated differently if they seek help ￼. Worrying about privacy or not wanting peers to know can prevent someone from calling a counselor or attending therapy.
	•	Anonymity concerns: Related to stigma, some students worry counseling isn’t anonymous. They may fear others finding out they sought help or meeting someone they know in the counseling center. This can particularly affect students from small communities or tightly-knit campuses.
	•	Language and cultural barriers: Counseling services may not always be available in students’ first language or may not feel culturally sensitive. Non-native English speakers or international students can feel misunderstood. For example, one case study found that language barriers made it hard for students to express themselves, and an app that offered support in their native language helped them open up ￼. Campuses that offer therapy in multiple languages and culturally diverse counselors help reduce this barrier ￼.
	•	Awareness (Mental health literacy): Some students simply don’t know how to recognize they need help or what resources exist. First-generation or young students might not have learned about mental health in their families. Colleges often need to educate students on the signs of mental strain and how to reach out.
	•	Fear of loss of independence: Some older students worry that seeking help might label them as having a “mental illness,” which could concern employers or parents (even though patient privacy laws protect this).

Each of these barriers can make it harder for a student to ask for help when they need it. That’s why it’s important to foster open conversations and improve access: faculty, friends and student leaders can encourage mental well-being, highlight resources, and remind everyone that getting help is a sign of strength, not weakness ￼ ￼. Many schools are working to extend counseling hours, provide online support, and normalize talking about mental health.

General Well-being Tips (Proactive Self-Care)
	•	Maintain a balanced routine: Regular sleep (7–9 hours), healthy meals and exercise are the foundation of good mental health ￼ ￼. A simple step like a daily walk or taking stairs can improve mood.
	•	Manage stress early: Don’t ignore stress or assume “it’ll pass.” Try stress-reduction techniques daily, like deep breathing, meditation or listening to music. Recognize when you feel overloaded and take short breaks. SNHU experts advise students to “prioritize and organize your work, develop healthy habits, practice self-care and reach out for support when you need it” ￼.
	•	Stay socially connected: Keep in touch with friends and family. Make time for fun or relaxation with people you care about. Social interaction helps buffer stress and loneliness ￼ ￼.
	•	Set realistic goals: Break big goals into achievable steps and celebrate progress. Avoid “all-or-nothing” thinking. Remember every small step counts toward improvement.
	•	Practice self-compassion: Treat yourself kindly. Everyone faces difficulties sometimes. If you make a mistake or have a bad day, remind yourself that imperfections are normal.
	•	Limit harmful coping: Avoid excess caffeine, alcohol, nicotine or drugs as a way to feel better – they often make stress and mood issues worse. Instead, try healthy coping like hobbies, spending time outdoors or talking to someone.
	•	Mindfulness and relaxation: Spend a few minutes each day unwinding. Even short exercises (like stretching, taking a few deep breaths, or a 5-minute meditation) can reduce daily tension.
	•	Seek support proactively: Use campus resources not only in crisis but as preventive care. Many schools offer workshops on stress management, peer support groups or wellness apps. You don’t have to be in crisis to benefit.
	•	Stay informed: Learn about mental health. Knowing the signs of stress, anxiety or depression can help you catch issues early in yourself or friends. Educational events or online materials (like the NIMH and SAMHSA websites) offer free information.

Remember, taking care of your mental health is an ongoing process, not a one-time fix. By being proactive – noticing when you feel off, reaching out early, and using healthy habits – you can improve your well-being and enjoy your student years more fully ￼ ￼. If you’re ever unsure or overwhelmed, talking to a counselor or a trusted adult can help you find balance and support.
